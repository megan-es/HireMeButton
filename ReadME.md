Interactive "Hire Me!" Button with Bokeh

This project showcases an interactive "Hire Me!" button developed using the Bokeh library. When clicked, the button reveals a brief introduction and some essential links, such as LinkedIn, Github, and Tableau Public profiles.

Features:
An interactive button that, when clicked, displays personal and professional details.
Links to LinkedIn, Github, and Tableau Public profiles for easy navigation and connection.
Developed using Bokeh for a seamless integration into web applications.

Setup:
Ensure you have the Bokeh library installed. If not, install it using pip:
Copy code
pip install bokeh

Running the Script:
To run the script, navigate to the directory containing the Python script.
Use the following command to serve the script using Bokeh:
css
Copy code
bokeh serve --show python_script.py
This will automatically open a browser window displaying the interactive button.

How it Works:
The Bokeh library is utilized to create an interactive button and a hidden Div element. The button is initially displayed, and when clicked, the hidden Div is updated with content containing personal and professional details.

This project serves as a dynamic and interactive way to present one's professional credentials in a fun and engaging manner. It can easily be integrated into personal websites, portfolios, or other platforms.
